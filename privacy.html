<h1>Privacy & Compliance Statement</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-05-26</p>
<h2>No Personal Data Collection</h2>
<p>Culture Flip is a static educational website that does <em>not</em> ask users to create accounts, enter names, e‑mail addresses, or any other personal identifiers. All interactions occur entirely within the user’s device.</p>

<h2>Technical Logs</h2>
<p>Our hosting platform (GitHub Pages) may retain minimal, non‑identifying technical logs (IP address, browser type) for up to 7 days solely for security and operational purposes. These logs are automatically deleted and are never combined to create user profiles.</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p>We may use your browser’s localStorage to remember which cards you have already flipped. This data never leaves your device and can be cleared at any time via your browser settings.</p>

<h2>COPPA & GDPR</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>COPPA:</strong> Because we do not collect, store, or transmit personal information from children under 13, parental consent is not required.</li>
  <li><strong>GDPR & CCPA:</strong> The site processes no personal data; therefore, data‑subject rights requests are not applicable.</li>
</ul>
